NLog supports several logging levels, each with its own significance:
Trace: The most detailed level, typically used for diagnostic purposes.
Debug: Used for debugging information that can be helpful during development.
Info: General information about the application's operation.
Warn: Indicates a potential issue that does not disrupt the application.
Error: Indicates a failure that should be investigated but doesn't necessarily crash the application.
Fatal: Indicates a critical failure that should be addressed immediately.
